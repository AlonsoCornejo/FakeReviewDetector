      <td>overall review overall i am pretty smitten with this graphics card newegg or their algorithm was so kind as to select me in the shuffle and so i felt lucky to get this at the price i did in the current gpu market newegg is essentially giving up potential profits they could have gathered to honor a more fair pricing for their customers and i wont forget that moving forward newegg has to compete in an environment with other major competitors so i think this was a pretty classy move on their part the 3080 ti is everything i wanted it allows me to play every game i have tried with a truly good experience usually at max settings at 4k often exceeding 60fps and sometimes approaching 120fps paired with a gsync monitor is the way to go on games like cyberpunk i am getting about 50 fps at max settings and the gsync keeps it mostly smooth and on games like far cry 5 i get about 110120 fps on 4k max which keeps the action both crisp and smooth like nothing i have experienced before 2k 60 fps with vsync used to be the standard for me that i aimed for and sometimes when a game was too much for my graphics card i would just have to save the game for new hardware in the future because vsync at 30 fps was unplayable to me coming from a 980 ti this new setup is really worth it additionally i was concerned about coil whine because its kind of a gamble and as much as i can garner its kind of up to the individual manufacturers gigabyte msi etc on how to finally assemble a graphics card and coil whine is not a concern for some of them i once owned a r9 290x that squealed like a pig and it was truly unbearable so i either got lucky with this 3080 ti or gigabyte is good at making graphics cards not squeal i dont know but all i can say is my unit does not have coil whine and the fans are fairly quiet to boot i couldnt be happier which is nice when spending this much money coil whine is present but not that bad running unregulated fps during menus etc which is normal its possible that at 144hz plus applications coil whine could become an issue but even this cards worst whine that i have heard has been pretty tame i run an almost silent air cooled setup with a heavily vented computer case so their is very little sound insulation as well with my configuration if youre looking at this card price versus performance has already gone out the window so dont let the naysayer get you down the law of diminishing returns governs a lot in this world of ours top end gpus have never been a good buy until you could resell them recently i suppose buy with confidence and if you are worried about price versus performance this is probably not the card to buy if you want to play games now like cyberpunk 2077 at max settings at 4k this is one of the only cards that can do that at playable frame rates which is also subjective</td>
