I feel as though a school system 's sports program should give equal funds to different sports so each team has equal athletic appreciation . 
I play soccer for my high school , and I feel as though soccer does not get equal funds to football .
For example , the soccer fields have not been mowed since the beginning of the season ( approximately two weeks ) while the football field has been mowed nine or ten times and the season has n't started .
Since the first soccer game , the nets have not been taken down , but the goal pads from the football games are taken down immediately after the game .
Both are of equal value and both need the same time to take down . 
I know that the football team charges to attend but that does n't equal the amount of extra work the football field gets .
The football field just got new bleachers for the visiting team spectators , while the soccer field does n't even have bleachers for the home town spectators , like they did last season .
( Who knows what happened to the ones that were there before. ) During home games there are many fans watching a very exciting , skillful game of soccer who must stand for an hour and a half !
