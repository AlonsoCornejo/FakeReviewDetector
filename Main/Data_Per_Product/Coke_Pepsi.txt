Both Pepsi and Coke have finally taken to producing a cola sweetened with Splenda .
This is awesome , because Splenda is a 0-calorie ( though not 0-sugar -- be warned , diabetics ! ) sweetener , based on sugar ( it shows up on ingredients lists as 'sucralose ' ) so it does n't have that chemical aftertaste of aspartame ( Nutrasweet ) .
Now let me preface this by saying that I actually kinda liked Pepsi ONE ( when it had aspartame in it ) , at least much more than any other diet cola out there .
So I was really interested to taste it sweetened with Splenda .
Well , the aspartame aftertaste is gone .
It 's crazy . 
Or I 'll stick to Fresca ( which has aspartame , but it greatly tamed by the grapefruit flavor ) .
I do n't know what Coke was thinking , though .
Because they 've now introduced `` Coke Zero '' , which , near as I can tell , is basically old Diet Coke ( aspartame-sweetened ) , and Diet Coke is now Splenda-sweetened .
But be careful -- the Diet Coke with Splenda comes in a light blue and light yellow label , whereas the old Diet Coke still has the old silver label .
It seems like they'd 've been much better off making the new Splenda-sweetened stuff a new product line with a new name , rather than confusing the Diet Coke name ...
The Cola Battle Rages On ...
I have some friends who are die-hard Pepsi drinkers , and some friends/family that are die-hard Coke people ... so this seems as good as any topic to discuss in detail . 
So ... first things first ... lets make up some categories with which to judge :
Overall Taste , After Taste , Advertising Campaign , Merchandising Successfulness , Supporting flavours/products , and ...
usefulness as a weapon .
Well , everyone has their opinion on the matter .
If I were to walk to a refrigerator , and find both sitting there , my personal preference would be to grab a coke . 
Personally , I find that Coke tastes better most times .
Having said that , there are definitely times when I 'm not interested in drinking Coke at all , but I 'll get into that in a moment .
I give Coke the nod here ... feel free to disagree in the comments section , but this is really a personal preference thing .
Lets move on .
AFTER TASTE :
This is where I lean towards Pepsi in general .
I find Coke gives you that sticky taste in your mouth , and that your teeth hurt , and make weird noises when you rub them together after drinking Coke . 
Pepsi , not so much .
So , I give Pepsi the nod for after taste ...
ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN :
My biggest beef with Pepsi is their advertising campaign , and how they feel the need to specifically call Coke out in each commercial .
They rely on people to say ï¿½Coke is the big company , and I do n't like big companies , so I should drink Pepsi .
I just find that Coke puts out commercials of people dancing , and drinking Coke , and loving it ... and Pepsi puts out commercials of ... people not drinking Coke .
It 's so silly .
Pepsi is like that kid running for high school students council who has no chance of winning , so instead of actually coming up with a reason why you should vote for them , they put up posters saying why you should n't vote for others . 
You see Coke anywhere you look ... trading cards , clocks , posters , telephones , cup holders , etc , etc , etc .
Unfortunately for Coke , the fact that they win this category is a bad thing in my opinion , because I 'm getting a little sick of seeing it .
I live with a guy who collects the stuff like it 's going out of style ... oddly enough , its the stuff that is 'classic ' that is most in style . 
So ... Coke being everywhere , and getting on my nerves more than Pepsi in this area , give the advantage to Pepsi .
