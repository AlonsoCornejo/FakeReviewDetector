Yelp Review Text,Classification,Reason
"Let me begin by saying that there are two kinds of people, those who will give the Tokyo Hotel 5 stars and rave about it to everyone they know, or... people who can't get past the broken phone, blood stains, beeping fire alarms, peg-legged receptionist, lack of water pressure, cracked walls, strange smells, questionable elevator, televisions left to die after the digital conversion, and the possibility that the air conditioner may fall out the window at any moment. That being said, I whole-heartedly give the Tokyo Hotel 5 stars. This is not a place to quietly slip in and out of with nothing to show but a faint memory of the imitation Thomas Kinkade painting bolted to the wall above your bed. And, there is no continental breakfast or coffee in the lobby. There are a few vending machines, but I'm pretty sure they wont take change minted after 1970. Here your senses will be assaulted, and after you leave you will have enough memories to compete with a 1,000 mile road-trip. I beg anyone who is even mildly considering staying here to give it a chance. The location is prime. We were able to walk down Michigan Ave and the river-walk in the middle of the night, all without straying too far from the hotel. There is a grocery store a block away and parking (which may cost more that your hotel room) across the street. Besides, this place is cheap. Super-cheap for downtown Chicago. The closest price we found in the area was four times as expensive. But, be sure to grab some cash. They don't accept credit cards. Some rules though: - Say hello to Clifton Jackson, the homeless guy by Jewel-Osco. - Buy him a drink, some chicken and look him up on Facebook. - Stay on the 17 floor. All the way at the top. - Go out the fire escape (be sure to prop the door open or you'll have a looong walk down) - Be very very careful. - Explore. (Yes, that ladder will hold your weight) - Be very very careful. - Don't be alarmed by any weird noises you hear. - Spend the night on the roof. 17 stories up, in the heart of Chicago. - Write your own Yelp review. I want to see that others are getting the Tokyo Hotel Experience. - Check out is at noon. Be sure to drink lots of water. - Spend the next day hung over. And... Please be careful on the roof.",0,
"The only place inside the Loop that you can stay for $55/night. Also, the only place you can have a picnic dinner and get a little frisky on the 17th floor roof and then wake up in your room the next morning to an army of ants going in on your picnic leftovers.",1,"""only place inside the loop"""
"I have walked by the Tokyo Hotel countless times. It reminds me of the type place that Peter Parker lives in in the Spiderman movies, Or the sort of place Marla Singer might live in, or maybe it is a carbon copy of the Hotel Zamenhof. Basically it is scuzzy and sleazy, through and through it is a fleabag, and I love it. Yesterday I finally walked in. I don't know why. Maybe because I just told my roommates and my landlord that I wouldn't be signing another lease, essentially leaving me ""pre-homeless"". Maybe because earlier that day I told boss that I'm quitting my job at the end of July, leaving me ""pre-unemployed"". Maybe because after all this time teetering between living on the edge of salvation and the brink of self destruction, I'm finally choosing my path, I'm hitting bottom. I'm giving up. Shit maybe I'm Nick Cage in Leaving Las Vegas, but where is my Elizabeth Shue? Who will look after me, who will walk me gently into that good night? If I choose to stay in this city, the city I love, then I may just stay in the ""Hotel Tokyo"". Because if I choose to stay, and that is a big if, then I'm going to need to stay somewhere cheap, with like-minded vagabonds, vagrants and naredowells. I'll need help, I'll need guidance.",1,"""it reminds me of"" ""Carbon copy of"""

"This place is disgusting, absolutely horrible, it is my second stay here, there is a strange stain on the other side of the bed I stay on, and my friends and I are rendered air conditionless, but it is 55 for downtown Chicago, what am I suppose to do?",0,
"Disgusting!!! There is literally duct tape holding together the elevator. Crack heads live here.. not safe! Walked in, bought a room.. saw it and left. No locks on doors, no parking, no air conditioning, no way! For the $$ you pay for the room ($ 55 a night) and parking ($ 38 a night) you could stay down the street at The Ohio House and NOT sleep with one eye open. Would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy. Seriously, DO NOT STAY HERE!",1,"""you could stay down the street at the ohio house"""
"This hotel came up on Hotwire for $108 a night. We wanted to stay in this area so we took it. The Tremont is an older hotel updated to boutique style. I'm rather amazed by some of the other snarky reviews -- if you want rooms like the Drake or the Four Seasons, book yourselves there and pay the price!  In fact, our room (910) was fine. It's a bit small, but large enough to hold a rather monumental king size bed with a giant headboard. Perfectly comfortable. There's decent free WiFi and plenty of outlets. The bathroom has a slightly odd layout but is a bit larger than at the Inn of Chicago, where we stayed the first two nights we were in town. You also can't beat the location -- half a block west of Michigan Ave. at the Water Tower. So there's no end of shopping and dining facilities. You're a couple of blocks walk to Oak Street Beach and the El station.  It's true that there's only one elevator, so be prepared for it to be slow, especially when it's check-out time. But this is a small quibble. Haven't tried the continental breakfast at Ditka's yet. But we did notice a caf in the plaza at the John Hancock building across Michigan Ave. that offers breakfast, coffees, etc. that probably should be decent. There's also a Starbucks right across the street from the hotel. Also the hotel has only 20 TV channels and doesn't carry MSNBC, to which I'm kind of addicted.  In short, no real complaints. The Tremont more than meets our needs at a great price!",1,"""rooms like the drake and four seasons"""
"Good location, really run down. I am surprised SPG lends their reputation to this property.",0,
"Beautiful lobby. The rest is a dump. The elevator should be in an amusement park. The rooms are nice, if you like lumpy beds, peeling wallpaper, caked on dust on the air vents, disgusting bathrooms, and zero customer service. If they were a hostel, I'd be more understanding. But this place purports to be a classy old hotel.  If you're a hobo looking for a flophouse, this might be for you. There are plenty of dumpsters nearby for any biscuit-spearing you might have on your itinerary. By all means, catch a cannonball to chi-town but mind the bone polishers. If you are a non-hobo, look elsewhere.",0,
"Stayed here when I went to Chicago for a wedding. The hotel had an old world charm that my husband and I liked and made us choose this over something more modern. Yes, the hotel only had 1 small elevator which made it a little inconvenient when there were multiple groups (with luggage) at the same time, which reminded me of a hotel in Europe. The rooms were modest, the bathroom was fine, everything was clean... not luxurious, but what do you expect. The location itself is conveniently located just off the main street. I think we ended up paying $160 per night (after taxes were added) during the weekend in July, which was cheap for that area when we looked. Overall, fairly comfortable and affordable, a decent option.",1,"""choose this over something more modern"""
"I bleed SPG loyalty blood to the point where I will walk or drive an extra 15-20 minutes to stay at a Starwood property just to get the points, but if the Westins downtown are booked again...I think that I may have to reconsider my tactics, because The Tremont is a dump.  This property is an embarrassment to the brand. Three things come to mind. 1) The room's wallpaper and paint were perhaps current when leisure suits were legitimately fashionable. 2) The hotel doesn't have a gym or a restaurant. 3) I called down to the front desk because someone literally stole the cord off the back of the television and I wanted to watch the news, but there was no answer. What kind of @!#$%!@#$ hotel doesn't answer at the front desk? I ended up calling six times and never got through to the front desk, so I finally just took the one (yes, one) elevator down there. I couldn't find a single person who works for the hotel. Stay classy, Tremont. I won't be back.",1,"""but if the Westins downtown are booked again"" comparing to another hotel"
"I'm a SPG Platinum member and can't believe that Starwood even keeps this property in their portfolio. I'm writing from the dingy room as we speak. Pro: It was $100 for a Thursday-Sunday room in early December, when prices usually spike around the Magnificent Mile. Cons: only 1 (slow) elevator, very old and dingy decor, poor front desk service, no movies, very few electrical plugs. I could have chosen between the Hampton Inn and Tremont. I stayed at the Hampton a month ago and should have stayed there again. Yes it's cheap and close to Michigan Ave, but if you are a business traveller and accustomed to SPG standards, this is not your place!",1,"""I could have chosen between"""
"Pros: fantastic location at a good price, stately building, big comfortable bed Cons: slightly smelly room, horrible hot water pressure, no on-command movie TV system, front desk usually unoccupied Overall: would use again, but first would try other comparably-priced hotels in same neighborhood.",1,"""first would try other hotels"""
"I stayed here a couple of times in 2011, as this was the hotel-of-choice for my sister's wedding last summer. It definitely had a lot of charm, but it was quite outdated and a bit run down (peeling wallpaper, for example). The elevator was INCREDIBLY SLOOOOOW - and just one passenger elevator for 16 floors meant lots of waiting around. (There was a service elevator that some used instead, but it was equally as slow.) For the location and the price, though, it's a pretty good place to stay.",1,"""instead"""
"let us begin with the seven min wait for the one elevator. we get to the room and the key card will not work. the new one works after 4 or5 swipes. the a/c works great after eight hrs. if one person wishes to take a shower and the other a bath you are in luck because the tub does not drain. also if you are not sure if you should be green and use only one towel, the tremont makes this easy! They only give you one towel per person. I must say it really is in a great location and the people that work there are really nice, This place just needs lots of work.",0,
"This is an older property, so the decor is dated. This is not up to par with other SPG properties. No gym. A sparse continental breakfast of desserts and cereal is provided in the adjacent Ditka's restaurant. My bf is an SPG platinum elite member. Daniel upgraded us to the penthouse suite three days before our reservation. However when we arrived, it was unavailable due to construction. We were transferred to a suite in which one shower did not function, and the bathroom reeked of urine. We complained to the manager, who stated she did not smell anything unusual. With the help of our SPG representative, we switched to a different hotel.",0,"word ""older"" but not used comparatively"
"Traveling on a budget is what brought me here. If I was not I would have been at the Sofitel or the Grad Hyatt. Location, location, location is the draw here. Located near North Michigan, and Rush is very convenient. Initially we had a queen and requested to upgrade to a Kind facing the front. They did this without any extra charge. Kudos to the staff for being accommodating. I have to warn you though, the carpet mixed with the burning candles they have throughout the lobby was nauseating to me. The carpet needs to be changed in the lobby as well as in the elevator. The floor and the rooms were fine thought, Thank God! This hotel has so much potential to redeem it's old world charm, but it seems like money may be tight.",1,"""I would have been at the Sofitel or the Grad Hyatt"""
"Small Rooms....one elevator that takes forever to come down to the first floor. Had a second elevator or service elevator, but it did not work at all. The elevator that worked could only hold 5 people at a time. One plus is the location.  Ditkas was Awesome and right next door.",0,
"Great location, terribly outdated. Feels like my grandmother decorated it, complete with overwhelming smell of cranberry potpourri in the lobby. Nothing extra, no frills, no service, no greeting when you walk ing. You can pay $5 for muffins and coffee in the morning, no eggs, no room service. If you're on a budget, at least it's clean, maybe not comfortable.",0,
"As Martha would say, ""What a dump!"" Although not without its charm, the Tremont is old and with the apparent exception of the penthouse suite described below, not very well kept. The elevator creaks and makes thumping noises. My room smelled mildewy, the wallpaper was peeling, and the paint was chipped. The AC (which had an ""on"" setting and an ""off"" setting) pumped dusty air through a rusty vent surrounded by a corona of water stains in the ceiling. At 11:30 pm, I awoke to the sound of a door slamming over and over and over again. I staggered out into the hall to confront whatever ingrate was making the noise only to find that the elevator was stuck on the floor and the door was opening and slamming shut. During my three night stay, my key card magically deactivated four times. Don't be fooled by their website, which lists room amenities that you may find within. There is no room service, no in-room coffee pots, and when I asked about the promised in hotel ""fitness center,"" the desk clerk said I could go to the Westin Hotel around the corner and, once they called the Tremont to verify my status as guest, use theirs. The TV in my room offered a dim, warped, off-color view of the five available channels. There are no window screens and a card on the desk cautioned that opening a window would lead to bugs, attracted by the lights, flying into the room. Because I am soft, I gave the place three stars because the employees are polite, helpful, and well-practiced in coping with angry guests. The lobby is also gorgeous and I had a pretty decent view of the Hancock out of my window. It is also cheap as hell for a hotel off Michigan Ave. Still, if you are looking for a hotel with more comfort and less character, and you can afford it, stay somewhere else.",0,
"My husband and I came to Chicago for a week and decided to stay here. The price was right and it's in a very convenient neighborhood. Yes, it's old and small but we had a good time here. We stayed in a room with one queen bed and it was more spacious than I thought it would be. You could tell one wall had some water damage at one time, but everything was clean and everything worked. I didn't deal with the staff besides checking in and out, but the people I did speak with were friendly. There weren't a ton of amenities but I didn't come to Chicago to hang out in my hotel room. The train is only a few blocks away and you're surrounded by tons of places to go shopping. I would definitely stay here again.",1,"""more spacious"""
"My mom stayed here 4 or 5 years ago and loved its quaint charm, so when she met me in Chicago at the tail end of a business trip, we were excited to find that Hotwire had placed us here. Things have apparently changed. No room service, no vending or ice machines on the floors and no in-room coffee. The room was clean but a bit beyond ""charming"" in terms of falling apart. The blinds were broken in the bedroom and there weren't any in the bathroom, so you got to pee and shower in full view of the church below and the adjacent corner of hotel rooms. The water didn't drain out of the tub, so by the time I finished a quick shower, I was already shin-deep in water. SICK. The elevators were terrifying. I am all for old, quaint, authentic and charming but this place has really let itself go. Get me some coffee in my god-damned room and some ice machines so I can keep my champagne cold and I'll stop bitching. Promise.",0,
"Stayed here over the Jan 15th weekend. The location is perfect! Close to Michigan Avenue, train and of course Giordano's. Inviting entrance to the hotel with a canopy with heat lamps when you walk up. The elevator is small and a little rickety but it does the job. I would bring your own towels as the hotel ones are a bit scratchy. Didn't encounter the hotel staff much, just at check in/out -they were polite. I would stay again when in town.",1,"""The location is perfect"" superlative"
"Checked into the room for the Cubs-Cardinals series in early August. Found the rate online and my critieria was cheap so I guess I can't complain. Location was great. Steps from Michigan Ave and Rush St. On the down side, as we were checking in, a woman at the front desk was asking how to make the tv work, because she could only get a couple channels. ""Oh...sorry...our cable is out until next week."" Yeah...right! That should have been the first sign that this long-in-the-tooth motel was going to be no-frills. So, not only is the tv limited to local only snow-casts, but having imbibed on great Chicago chow, I soon discovered that the toilet takes about 10 minutes and 5 or 6 flushes to disappear the package. Yucko! Still, with its proximity to just about everything, it was quite a bargain for 3 nights ($159 per). Just would have appreciated a little love on the bill after the cable outage. Ditka's adjoining restaurant made it barable.",0,
"This is a gem of a hotel just off the Magnificent Mile. The rooms are nothing to get excited about, but the location and the staff make it great. If you're looking for the typical big chain hotel room, this isn't it. If you want a quaint hotel, with comfy beds, hot water, and clean sheets, this is perfect. Great rates available just check the hotel sites for deals. Ditka's place is right next door for eats, and Starbucks is across the street...perfect!",0,
"Breakfast no longer free, but the wifi is. The staff were friendly and responsive, and the price-for-location hard to beat.",0,
"In some aspects I have to agree with Sam from Indiana. But, I do have to say when we get away, SERVICE is a huge thing. Zaiia at the front desk and the Bellman Tom were very nice to us through our whole entire visit. Valet Parking = $49/day with in and out privileges. (We walked or cabbed it everywhere) We too received this through Hotwire...",0,
cheap hotel for the location.. i paid under a 100 bucks a night (not including tax)... as for the hotel itself.. it's a bit dated.. however the bed is really comfortable.. towels are relatively soft too there's only 1 elevator available for customers.. however they will open up the service elevator if it's busy.. the wifi is free and pretty quick too..,0,
"I can't imagine paying full price to stay here. We got a deal from a travel site, which made it worthwhile because the location is terrific. The photos on yelp seem to be professionally lit, and very misleading. If I had paid full price, I would have been pissed. But, if you're the sort of person who can deal with a youth hostel, then you'll love it here! The lobby is clean and inviting, but the charm disappears after that. Our room was small, dingey, with blistering walls, painted on crown molding, and worn drapes. No refrigerator or anything, so don't bring home any leftovers. But, on the bright site, the bed and sheets were very clean. The mattress seemed quite new--I'm a mattress inspector the instant I walk into any hotel room. The shower had AWESOME water pressure and got quite hot quite fast, and the AC could pump a lot of cold air in fast. I imagine this place was quite the jewel like 30 years ago. We did bring some leftovers into our room that got a little smelly (before we realized there wasn't a fridge) and my husband took the bag of food (from Frontera, so sad we couldn't keep it!!!) to the concierge and explained he wanted to throw it away. The guy gave my husband directions to the dumpster out back!!! OMG. Even a Ramada concierge would say, ""Oh, let me take that for you sir."" So, anyhow, if you're looking for a place to sleep, take a hot shower, and have zero expectations beyond a clean, safe place to sleep, this is your spot. It is withing walking distance of a LOT of awesome stuff. But PLEASE go find a deal somewhere on line!! If you're looking for romance, indulgence, pampering: run away!",0,
"So get this yelpers....I had the WORSE flying experience this past October(09) from SFO to Ohare...I'll yelp that botchjob in a sec, but anywhoo, I called the hotel after landing and mentioned that I was just making sure all was well, due to EVERYTHING ELSE going wrong that day. And when I get to the Tremont, ya wanna know what happened? "" You sounded so stressed out on the phone earlier we upgraded your room"" Pimp. Nice. I didn't even know they had rooms that large..and they got Ditka's to take our order at closing, and the hotel delivered our food to our door.In fact they pretty much spoiled us our whole visit(they even played gatekeeper for an annoying relative of mine..we of course tipped them for it) I love these bitches.See you in october 2010!",1,"""WORSE"""
"For the money.. it was a great hotel. Clean, great location, comfortable and fabulous staff. I enjoy older hotels with character.. The Tremont fit the bill. Great views, There weren't an abundance of tv channels, but the picture was clear and I sure didn't travel to Chicago to stay in the room and watch tv. and would prefer not to pay higher rates so others can. I would so stay here again. I wish I could remember the desk clerks name .. she was awesome in answering questions about the area.",0,"""older"" comparative word but not used in a comparative way"
"I agree that this place is pretty small, but in the city it's hard to find a place this cheap that isn't. The value is huge with this place. It's in a great place, standard high-er end rooms, and above all pretty quiet. We stayed Halloween weekend and had no issues with hearing people in the hallway/people hearing us. The crowd seemed to be mixed, some young some older so I was little worried about noise level, but nothing happened (which is more than I can say for some of my other hotel visits). I mostly interacted with the night guy. He was great. Really knew a lot about the hotel/area and he was very friendly- even went out of his way to find me a lighter :) The biggest downside was really just that they never asked if we needed more than one key, so at a few points in time I got locked out of the room and had to call someone to let me back in... but that was pretty minor :) Can't wait to stay again!",1,"""other hotel visits"""
"My fiance and I vacationed to Chicago for 5 days & 4 nights; he picked The Tremont. At first, I was confused on the hotel: do I like it or hate it? The lobby is old fashioned in the sense with beautifully decorated with wooden crown moldings and leather sofa's. The receptionist didn't acknowledge us when we entered or exited, however, they were very attentive when I needed something. (IE: I wanted more towels & i got them in less than 5 minutes). The room was average, but very clean. At first, I was annoyed at how different the room looked in comparison to the photos, but my fiance made me change my mind: were we there to stay in a room the whole day or were we in Chicago to sight see? He was right: who cares? The best part: it was cheap ($85 a night) and walking distance to SO MANY attractions: a block away from million mile, short walk to the beach/Lake Michigan, 2 blocks from the Chicago Trolley, short walk to several bars and restaurants, to name a few. They also allowed me to receive and send faxes for free! For the price other hotels were charging, I would definately recommend this place!",1,"""how different the room looked in comparison to the photos"""
"Realy small hotel but it's in a great location in downtown chicago. The rooms itself are pretty well maintained. The lobby is fairly nice. Elevators are small, I don't know if that's the theme they are going for, cozy.... The price isn't that expensive considering you are in downtown chicago. A decent room with an okay view ran me up about a little over a hundred a night, though It's all about location location location. I almost never saw the staff other than check in and check out, maybe that's a good thing... I'd come back again if I'm ever in chicago.",0,
"Great location for walking to any part of downtown Chicago you could want. The hotel was old, but not in any way that caused any kind of problem. The lobby was very nice; I understand it had recently been renovated. The room and other areas were clean, the staff was friendly and helpful. The water in the room was hot and had good pressure! My only complaint was that the walls were a little thin, so I could hear my next door neighbor. Luckily he seemed to be a Japanese business man who didn't do anything other than talk on the phone and watch TV, but a different neighbor could have been a different situation! Overall, the hotel was a great value for the location, and very clean and comfortable. I would stay there again!",0,
"Excellent location right down the street from Michigan Ave and John Hancock building. Can't forget free wi-fi and breakfast. The hotel is old, and the elevator is a bit scary at times, but it really was a value and we would definitely stay here again.",0,
"Great location for a good price. Book it directly on their website and get the AAA price for the best deal. Hotel has that old Chicago charm. Bed was comfortable and the room was clean. Bathroom appeared to have been updated in the past few years. 32"" flat screen in the lowest cost room. (single queen) Was able to connect my laptop to it and watch videos. Could tell that the woodwork in the rooms was old, probably the original. But it was still in good condition and fit the building. They have some kind of incense/oil going in the lobby and it might be on the strong side for some people, but it didn't bother me. Continental breakfast is available at the Mike Ditkas next door for $5 a person. It isn't anything special but what's there is decent. Overall it's a very nice hotel. I dont need much for amenities above a clean room and comfy bed and this hotel fit that perfect. Free wi-fi is an excellent bonus. For the money, it was the best deal in town if you dont need 5 star accomodations. One quick note, during my stay in March 2011 the building next door was being torn down so the construction crews were working early weekday mornings. I'd expect that a new hotel is being built and would take some time once the demo is complete.",0,
"Paid $140 for a room on this past Thursday. It was a last resort after the Sofitel was booked up and most of my coworker were staying there so I needed to be close bye. Boy did I get the shaft on this business trip. I normally stay at the Sofitel which is amazing but this hotel can't compare in any way except the location. The check bell hop was very nice but besides him, the staff was not very helpful and kind of rude. I was told nothing about the hotel when checking in. I was barely spoken too actually. The room looks ok when I walk in, it was clean but older looking. The nightmare came at 2:30 am when I heard the couple next door having a good time soo clearly I felt like they were in my room. The walls were soo thin and the doors had more than enough room on the bottom for sound to come through. At 5 am the same couple wakes me again as they are getting ready and leaving their room. I finally fall asleep again just to be woken up by the cleaning staff cleaning that room at 7 am and again it sounded like they were in my room. I will never stay here again.",1,"""I normally stay at the Sofitel"" different hotel"
"Location is AWESOME. It's across the street from Water Tower. If I was doing a girls night out, I would stay here! Yeah, the room we got was small. But this is an experience! It's a beautiful, historic hotel! The room design is different...artistic, some of my friends loved it! Some-hated it!",0,
"40 minutes to check in ... Drafty windows which made the room damp on a very rainy day and the heat is shut off in the summer (It was 57 last night) The sink stopper was broken, the shower backed up. The elevator makes you feel as if you are being buried alive (if it is working) otherwise, you get to use the service elevator from the kitchen. Which smells awful! All for 300 bucks a night! There was a convention in town and am sure prices were raised accordingly. It's like camping in Goldcoast! Here's the best part - I asked the front desk agent to call me a cab ... She walked me to the front door and whistled and walked back inside ...",1,It's like camping in Goldcoast!
"Another Travelzoo deal at an awesome price of $99 per night. The Tremont is located just a few blocks off the Magnificent Mile on Chestnut, right next to Ditka's. The lobby is narrow and have some seating in cozy groups with little candy dishes scattered around. My first impression upon checking in was that customer service is not their high suit. More to come on this in a moment. I get my key, some maps and a reminder about the free internet and breakfast in the morning served next door at Ditkas for $5 (free with my package but I pass so I can't speak to this). I get up to my room and open the door. The room itself is spacious for what it is. There's a separate sink vanity and spacious closet and roomy bathroom with shower over tub. The plumbing hardware was a bit off and needed a serious update because they were circa 1960s (think Edward Scissorhands ). The bed was very firm and the fitted sheets were shallow on the corners so if you were making cupcakes, they'd totally flip off (see picture). Another sign of this hotel's age was that the window coverings were old mini blinds. And another pet peeve for me is the linens. These were of inferior quality with a funky Motel 6-ish comforter/quilt and not a down comforter embraced in a high TC duvet. Yes, I have been spoiled with my Calvin Klein linens. Back to the service... Upon departure and asking for a copy of my statement for expense reimbursement, service was of 'eh quality. The response I got was my stay was prepaid (i.e. ""I'm not going to waste my time printing one for you""). I then explained I needed a copy anyway for reimbursement, then silence and no eye contact (i.e. ""I'm going to ignore your request""). So, annoyed, I then walk out but oddly get my back yelled at in a very loud tone (i.e. ""Ma'am!"" ""Ma'am!!""), 3 times, until I make it out the front door, keep in mind, there are 2 other guests in the lobby watching this unfold.. Unprofessional methinks. Hmmm.... Overall, for the price and the fact that I only had to spend 7 hours in the room, it was good enough.",1,inferior quality
"For the love of God, whatever you do, DO NOT take room 307. Suffice it to say that I would rather set my hair on fire than spend two minutes in that room. Shudder! After asking for another room, was pleased with what I got. The decor is a bit ""Quacker Factory-ish"" ala dried floral wreath, plaid pillow shams, etc. but overall, the room was clean, the bed comfy and the housekeeper..the nicest person I have ever met in a hotel!! The hotel is a bit older but you cannot beat the location. Enjoy the room for what it is, a place to sleep whilst in Chicago. Enjoy!",1,I would rather set my hair on fire than spend two minutes in that room
"Decent price for downtown Chicago over a weekend. Our room contained a air system which only produces heat in the winter and cold in the summer, so if it's one of those 80 degree days in February or March, I suppose you're screwed. Piano in the lobby needs tuning. Lobby is adjacent (attached opening) to Mike Ditka's. Bed excellent, TV above average, bathroom and cleanliness meet the standards.",0,
"We celebrated our one year anniversary by going downtown Chicago, getting a hotel room, and going to dinner and having drinks. This hotel was by far the worst hotel that I have ever stayed at. The room was cold one second, and than unbearably hot the next. Everything was extremely old, and out of date. The bathtub was very dirty, and the carpet in the room looked like it hasn't been shampooed in over a century. I've stayed at motels that were better than this.

"If you want a reasonably priced, clean, non-chain downtown Chicago hotel that's close to the Gold Coast, Mag Mile, CTA, etc. and can live without trendy decor or practically any amenities, this is a good option. As others have said, the decor is outdated, but the antique-like furnishings do give this place character, and it's very clean. You can't beat location -- stores, restaurants, lakefront, etc., are all very walkable. With the exception of wi-fi and shampoo/handcream in the room, this place offered absolutely no amenities -- even the free continental breakfast they offered last time I was here is gone, and they charged me $3 to store my luggage for a couple hours after I checked out -- every other hotel I've ever been to does that for free. All in all, I wanted a reasonably priced, clean, convenient place to crash while I was in Chicago, so this was a great option, but on trips to Chicago where my company is paying or I want a little more comfort, this would not be at the top of my list.",0,
"This hotel is OLD. Peeling paint, slow creaky elevators, dirty/scuffed baseboards, and ancient light lamps, wallpaper, and decorations. In my room, the walls actually had pretty sizable holes in them under the headboard and desk. The sheets were rough and I even felt the hard springs inside the mattress poking me a little as I tried to sleep. That said, the location is good (it's close to Michigan Ave and the Chicago Red Line stop), the price is cheap (even last minute), and housekeeping is phenomenal at keeping things immaculate, even if you don't leave your room until the afternoon. There was also free wifi, which improves pretty much any situation.",0,
"Don't kid yourself, you're paying for location and not much else. Mind you, the staff was nice and attentive, but that's mostly because they know it's the only thing that they've got to cling to. The facilities are atrocious. ""Quaint,"" or ""charming,"" or ""has character,"" would apply if the rooms were small but well maintained and attended to, which they aren't. The shower had barely warm water and backed up such that I had water about 4 inches deep by the end of my short, cold, shower. The images shown of the hotel are of the, admittedly, nice lobby and the penthouse suite. The actual room we stayed in? Comparable to the YMCA room I stayed in while on spring break in New Orleans during college. If it were anywhere else besides 1 block off of Michigan Ave., the phrase ""seedy dive"" would spring to mind. I really don't want to waste anymore of my time on this place, so I'll stop now. PS, we got it through Hotwire and they claimed it to be a 3 star ""boutique."" Crazy.",1,"""Comparable to"""
"I arrived at the Tremont this past weekend for one night only. I was staying in Chi Town for 2 nights but due to a convention in town this was the only hotel that had availability for the night and for $155 for the night I was more than willing to stay since I was getting rooms around the area for the rate of $350 and up! Lets just say here you are only paying for location. I ve learned that the ""older"" hotels are just NOT MY THING. The hotel lobby is pretty and leads you to believe the rooms will be the same. The staff was meh and the room, oh God the room. The room was so outdated! We had a one bedroom but for whatever reason it was two rooms combined into one (score!). For just two people it was pretty spacious and with two bathrooms and two tv sets then I guess I cant complain, but really I have to! The room smells like your grandmothers house and with the fixtures to boot! The carpet stunk, the sheets were stiff, the fixtures were old and dusty and lastly the bathrooms were old and falling apart. One of the bathrooms showers had brown water coming out of the faucet for the first 2 min! Since I only stayed a night I guess it could have been worse...thank goodness. - I also wish I can write a review about Ditkas since its downstairs but it was packed the night I wanted to eat there so I guess that says something good!",0,
"I have a fondness for older hotels that are a little down on their luck, so I ignored all the moaning around (on several sites) about the Tremont being . . so . . . so . . . OLD! Yeah, well--my wallpaper is peeling too. I found the Tremont to be very comfortable if a little overpriced (what downtown hotel isn't?) From my twelfth floor room I had a lovely view of the Lake--or would have if that damn Hancock Building hadn't been in the way. The Tremont is close to all the shopping on the Magnificent Mile, the Looking Glass Theater, Water Tower Place, the Hershey Store, Bistro 110--all the jostle and jump of the Water Tower neighborhood. Even though the Tremont is no more than a block from all the activity, Chestnut is a peaceful enough street that my room was quiet at all times. The Tremont staff seems polite and helpful; the bathroom seemed recently updated. The Continental Breakfast ($5.00) was only okay, but it was a sufficient jump start on Saturday morning. I was very happy with my stay at the Tremont and would recommend it to anyone except the most persnickety Felix Ungers out there.",0,
"Well this was an interesting place. I went to Chicago for one night with a group of friends (six of us) and we found the Inn at Lincoln Park by chance. Managed to book a room with two beds for just around $60 after fees, with a military discount. The hotel is really quite charming in an old boutique sort of way, but it is by no means fancy or super clean. Our room was very cool - used to be two rooms, so it had two walk-in closets and two full bathrooms. Since we are young and were just looking for somewhere to sleep for one night, it worked really well. I don't think I'd go back there with my family, though. Downside: I don't think they had cleaned the comforter OR sheets in a while. There were some interesting stains on them and the wall. We avoided these by using our own blankets and pillows. Perk: They have free breakfast downstairs every morning. Pretty decent. And they didn't seem to care that six of us were staying in one room.",0,
"Well..... I don't know where to begin.... Do I start with the room with no blinds.... or maybe that the TV didn't work... OH I know... the fact that the A/C didn't work!  A/C not working... We rented 2 rooms for 2 nights...135/night during NATO weekend, so we werent expecting a whole lot and thats exactly what we got. Only in 50% of the rooms the A/C worked. it would go on for about an hour and then just hummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm the rest of the night. We had corner rooms so there was plenty of light, 2 HUGE windows on 2 walls... the only problem was that 50% of the rooms didn't have freakin blinds!!!!! One of the walls faced West so, hello sun at 6:15am. Not a good thing when we were there for a bachelor party.  So being the lacrosse fan we are, we wanted to watch a little NCAA lax before heading out... only one problem, 50% of the 46 inch flat screens didn't work!  Couldnt find the "" Free High Speed"" WIFI. I will give credit where is it due... the bathroom was nice and large and the beds werent the worse I have slept on. The building was perfect placement for us.. close to Wrigleyville and Down Town. We brought all items to attention of the front desk... many a times it was ""its my first day sorry"" or ""I'll look into it"" with no result. When leaving we explained to them the issues again and we got ""wow your rate was only 135/night we are charging 250/night for this weekend, you should feel pretty lucky"" WTF who says that, fix the A/C!!!",1,"""worse"""
"The card key never worked. I even got an extra one from the front desk and it stopped working.  The room is big enough to stand up, turn around and thats it. big closet though, odd! The bed felt like a combination of springs and plywood. I think I could've slept better on the floor.  The heating in the building is odd. Its the old cast iron standing system which is controlled by a boiler int he basement. Walking into the room it was probably upper 80's even leaving the window open didn't help much. the knobs on the contraption didn't work.  Do not, and I repeat, DO NOT allow anyone to flush the toilet while you're in the shower. I thought this was something of the past. Oh wait, this place is in the past. Well anyway, im pretty sure second degree burns will happen. I was able to hit the shower head out of the way after the initial scalding. The location is ok, if you like a college town scenario, that college kids are screaming in the hallways between 2-4 am.  Thanks, but.... no thanks.",1,"""better"""
"I really liked the location and the building is super cute and rustic but that's about it as far as the positives go. Each and every single time my boyfriend and I left the room, we could not get back in using our keys. We know not to keep them near cell phones, etc. so something is amiss with their key/lock systems. It was quite annoying having to go all the way up our 4th floor room only to have to go back down to get another key, EVERY SINGLE TIME. I'm not exaggerating. Also, the furnace or whatever it was (sorry, I'm a FL girl so I have no idea what it's called) seemed to work only when it wanted and it got extremely hot in the room at times. Each night we had to leave the the window open so the temperature was tolerable, but even opening the window didn't work very well. After alerting the front desk to our issues, they simply shrugged it off and said it should be working. This place wasn't expensive, but I've stayed in equally inexpensive places and never had these issues. I think I will pick somewhere else when staying in Lincoln Park.",0,
"I won't go into details but basically employees at this hotel enforce policies in different ways. If one tells you something is okay to do, but the next person working disagrees....it will coat you the customer for there disorganization. When I asked if they expected me to check with every employee on how and which policies they enforced, they simply said yes. That is a burden no customer should bear and no customer should pay for employee disorganization.",0,
"I actually got a room for $60, including fees, through the Priceline ""pick your price"" promotion. I was really nervous about staying here because the reviews were so mixed. When we arrived we were relieved because the lobby is a lot nicer than the photos show. The parking was $15 but that was okay because it's expensive to park anywhere in Chicago. The staff were very friendly and quick. We were in town for a show at The Vic which was a short 15 minute walk! We felt safe in the neighborhood and there is a lot to do in the area. We stayed in a room with one double bed. Our room ended up being on the 4th floor in the stairwell (418 to be exact). It was small but it was fine for the two of us. The bathroom was very clean but the door didn't open past the toilet! It wasn't an issue for us but we thought it was a little odd. The room itself was clean except for a few hairs on our pillow cases (luckily we had brought our own). The bed was not the best bed ever but I could fall asleep fairly quickly on it. We thought the art hanging above the bed could stand to be changed and the walls need to be painted or wallpapered or something. Unfortunately there were some other guests that felt the stairwell would be a great place to fight and make noise from about 2:00 am until 6:00am. They were literally 5 feet from our room door. We heard a lot of door slamming and stomping around. I know this isn't the hotels fault but IF YOU STAY HERE REQUEST A DIFFERENT ROOM! We maybe got 3 hours of sleep. The breakfast was nothing special. The bagels were really hard but it was free so we didn't complain. The free wi-fi is very slow and won't work with any apps on a tablet/touch pad, just an internet browser because you have to ""log in"" every time you want to access something. It's not really worth using but will get the job done if you really need it. They also offer free coffee and hot tea in the lobby 24/7. We thought that was nice, especially because we were walking in the cold. Overall for the deal we got and the location it was not bad at all. We'll probably stay here again but just request a room not in the stairwell.",1,"""nicer"""
"The whole family stayed here for 4 nights this summer as we moved youngest sister into DePaul. The rooms were clean and well kept during our stay. The building is super old so there's some interesting character to the layouts. The lobby is comfortable, and the complimentary breakfast was standard warm continental. The desk staff was friendly and had maps available for us to take with us when we ventured out to explore. Met my expectations for a budget hotel, nothing stellar but no complaints. The best part obviously is the super convenient location: an easy walk from the train station, an easy walk to the park, zoo, lots of restaurants and shops.",0,
Great location but the hotel is super old and scary... like honestly I wouldn't walk around anywhere by myself. We recently stayed at the Conrad downtown for cheaper than here. PASS,1,"""We recently stayed at the Conrad downtown for cheaper than here"""
"I had a good experience here, for the most part. The building is old, and I liked that. It had some character. The room was clean and comfortable, the price was right, and the people were friendly and efficient. A great location too. As noted by other reviewers, the room was chilly.  BUT -- I was really put off by their blatant misrepresentation about wi-fi. The web site says: ""Complimentary high speed wireless internet access."" I have posted a picture of the sign on the building that says ""Fast Free HSIA,"" which must stand for high speed internet access.  And IT'S JUST NOT TRUE. When I checked in, the friendly desk clerk told me, standing not ten yards from that sign, that there was ""slow"" internet for free, but ""fast"" cost $6 an hour. She said the ""slow internet was OK for checking e-mail, but that's about it. She was right. VERY slow.  It's not a big deal to me whether there is a charge for internet. But it is a HUGE deal to me that the hotel flat-out misrepresents what you get for your money. Very offensive.",0,
"Oh man - where to start? Well, I saw a funny review on Orbitz which expresses my sentiments perfectly, so here's an excerpt... ""The Inn at Lincoln Park is located in one of Chicago's trendiest neighborhood and yet, the hotel itself does not live up to ... its surroundings. The comforter on the bed looked old and a bit worn and perhaps it was the combination of humidity that made me not want to take my shoes off... Oh, and I didn't feel comfortable sitting on the toilet seat without first covering it with toilet paper... When was the last time they cleaned that bathroom? On the plus side, I found the front desk staff to be very helpful and genuinely concerned about my comfort. It's in an EXCELLENT location and I felt very safe in the neighborhood. With that in mind, one night was enough for me."" So in summary: Pros: * location - lots of shops and food (the walgreens on the corner is closed right now though) * pleasant staff - very accommodating and helpful in my experience Cons: * the rooms - small, uncomfortable, and not clean I don't like to be too negative, so will leave it at that. Keep in mind that you're paying half or a third of the cost of a nice hotel, so you get what you pay for. If you've stayed in hostels through europe in your youth and can still stand it, this place is fine. So I'd say this is the right place if all you care about is having a bed to sleep on and would spend as little time as possible inside the room. I never realized I had become a hotel snob until I stayed here, so the Inn at Lincoln Park will always have a place in my heart. Somewhere in the back/bottom...",0,
"I joined Yelp tonight specifically to warn people away from this place. I arrived at 10:30 in the evening, and by the time I was in the room for 30 minutes I had already made reservations at another place; 15 minutes later I was already walking to the new place with my bags. I simply could not stay there. Peeling wallpaper, chipped paint, mystery stains on the carpet, a truly frightening bedspread, ripped chair cushions, scratched-up upholstery, and a general sense of uncleanliness; but the clincher was the security chain, which had clearly been broken in numerous times before, given the EIGHT bruised nail holes clustered around it. They did offer to upgrade me, but I simply had to leave. I am not a hotel snob, but that room just felt like a dirty motel at a truck stop. If it was $40 / night [in this neighborhood], I could see it. But over $100 / night?!?! No f-ing way. I went to the Day's Inn one block away for $13 / night cheaper...  I hate to be so negative, but they need to know they need to upgrade their facility; in the meantime, I can take some solace from helping others avoid the disappointment I felt.",1,"""another"""
"My wife and I stayed here on St. Pats weekend 2009. The lobby area is nice but I started to get a feeling of doom as we went through the hallway and stepped in the tiny elevator. I said to my wife, this hotel is small but quaint. Our room was exactly that, small but quaint. I wasn't expecting huge or modern. I was expecting current tech with nostalgia. Our room was fitted with a CRT tv (old style SD tv) and a small fridge (unstocked). We had a radiator for heat, purple tile in the bathroom and an old tub with a shower curtain.  The location is excellent for exploring the Wrigleyville area. Bus 22 will take you up and down Clark for $2 a trip. (don't be scared of the bus). The Inn offered a nice breakfast included with the fare. I thought the bed was comfortable and the room temp was fine. I opened the window before going to sleep, but had to close it by 1AM due to the street noise. The price is a little high for the location, but in a pinch you will not be disappointed. I will not be back unless the area is booked.",0,
"I stayed here on my last visit to Chicago... all hotels were booked that weekend, so that was the last resort and my expectations were low. I paid much more than I should have for a place like this one (almost $200 a night), but I think their regular rates are quite a bit cheaper if you book your room in advance. This said, the hotel was actually not bad. It's nothing fancy: very similar to your average Days Inn or Best Western, but the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful, and the room was clean. We even got a free upgrade (larger room). They have free breakfast (kind of crappy, but it's free...), and there is discounted parking at the hotel: $12, which is very cheap by Chicago standards. So... I'd have no problem staying there again, provided I can get a cheaper rate. 3-1/2 stars.",1,"""very similar to"""

I have never dreaded going back to a hotel to sleep for the night. Yes it's old, but apparently that also means dumpy.

The only thing I felt was clean were the sheets and I was still thinking about the possibility of bed bugs.

Bathroom is tight for two (really, it's tight for one), but a nice, hot shower. The accommodations for the marriage ceremony and reception were top notch, and everything from the bartenders to the hors d'ouevres were excellent. And the dinner was incredible -- not sure I've ever seen a kitchen send out this much food -- and complicated food (beef wellington), no less -- and have it come out hot, crispy and delicious.

I stayed in the motor inn section. The sheets & towels were worn & tired. The place just didn't look sparkling. There was a towel in the bathroom hung like maybe the maid had not seen it from the last guest. The tile was a bit scuffed. The bathroom could have used a fan, a new door, and a light in the shower.

The rooms were clean and spacious. Their choice of fabric patterns for the curtains were unfortunate. The entrance was really weird. What hotel doesn't have automatic doors? Getting your stuff into the hotel is like an obstacle course. First you push through two sets of doors (no button for handicapped people to access), then you have some steps to make it through. To get to the right wing, you have to go up some more steps before making it to an elevator. Someone didn't think this through very well.",1,"""dopplegangler"""

"We picked this hotel for a weekend away from the city because we thought Oak Park would be a nice place to unwind. The lobby had an old-world charm that lent the hotel a boutique feel. We splurged on a hot tub suite, and the tub was indeed the highlight of the experience. The bathroom was huge and seems to have been recently remodeled. The rest of the suite was immaculate, the front desk staff attentive, and the wi-fi as high-speed as advertised. For those that might be directionally-challenged, this hotel is off the beaten path and a bit difficult to locate. It is within walking distance from downtown Oak Park, though, so it is very convenient for those who would prefer to leave their car and spend the weekend on foot. I think the Carleton would benefit from the services of an interior decorator for the rooms. Much of the furniture seemed very traditional mid-price hotel style and boring. Not nearly as classy as the lobby might suggest. That was a bit disappointing. We did enjoy our stay, though the hotel was not amazing enough for us to feel an urgent need to book a second stay.",0,
"We picked this spot because it is the closest hotel to Forest Park. We paid amost $200 a night and we did get a suite. The suite was very large- but needs serious updating. The carpets were gross, the wall paper was coming loose, the furnture looked like it had been in a Frat house. Needless to say, the only reason we have chosen this place for a second time is due to it's location. I decided to ask the front desk manager if there were any remodels in the works. She did explain that all of the rooms have been or are in the process of being re-modeled. She also said that the suites were the last one scheduled for re-model. So, my suggestion would be to make sure you request a re-modeled room.",0,
"I got a room for my parents in the motel section of the Carleton and I was so pleased with the rooms! They are used to Holiday Inns but I wanted them closer to me in Oak Park.

I told my folks that if they didn't want to stay there, I would and they could have my apartment! They were very comfortable and pleased with the location, they said next time they come to town they will surely stay there!",0,
"Stayed in the ""Motor Inn"" section of the hotel. While the appointments were nice and everything was clean there were a few issues with the room, which should be addressed by the management.  First... the walls are like cardboard. I could hear everything my neighbors were saying, even though they were speaking at normal level. Fixing this would require sound insulation in the walls, during your next remodel. Second... there was a constant roaring sound coming from the bathroom vent, presumably from a fan. While the noise might not be that noticeable during the day, at night when everything is quiet, it becomes very noticeable and very annoying. Just get a new, quieter fan. I've read other reviews that complained about this as well. Third... get firmer mattresses. The mattress was a very cheap, weak mattress. The kind that squishes down to about 30% of its initial height. This makes for a very uncomfortable night sleep and a sore back the next day. With the above changes, this hotel could go from being second rate, to a real first class establishment.",0,
"I was born and raised in Oak Park, and my dad still lives there, so I had actually never been inside the Carleton until I booked a block of rooms there for out-of-town guests that attended my wedding in June of 2011. The Carleton is pretty sweet! It is old-fashioned without being run down. Our guests enjoyed staying there. It's in a nice part of Oak Park, with lots of restaurants and shopping nearby (as well as the Harlem Green Line and Metra stops- easy access to Chicago). I liked the variety of rooms (and prices) that were available for our guests to book. My husband and I booked the hot tub suite for two nights before and after our wedding. The hot tub was really nice and the room was perfect for all of the hair and makeup needs of my bridal party. The front desk staff was so nice and accommodating of us and all of our guests. Everyone recognized me as ""the bride"" and was especially considerate of my needs throughout the weekend. Their customer service made me feel special and very taken care of. We definitely brought the party back to Poor Phil's on Saturday following the wedding, and all of our guests had a blast. Thank you to the Carleton for putting up with us.

"I stayed at the Motor Inn section for one night prior to an interview. Staff was very helpful, prompt, and had a good sense of humor. There are two parts to the hotel - The Carleton and the Motor Inn sections. The Motor Inn section was very old timey hotel and reminded me of the ones i've stayed in in northern Wisconsin. I could not find the thermostat in the room but that may be because I'm an idiot... the room was a comfortable temperature anyway so it didn't matter to me. Internet is free but for some reason it didn't work at all. I had to use the internet at an attached restaurant (also free). I couldn't pull up directions the next day because they were both down and it was really frustrating. I don't really know what else to say about the place. There was a big bed, a TV with cable (thank you espnews!) to keep me company. There was enough soap that I could have showered 183 times and not made a dent in it. Very spacious room.

We held our ceremony and reception at the hotel, since we had a decent number of out-of-town guests and I didn't want them to have to deal with driving. (And how awesome is it to be able to party all night and then just be a short elevator ride away from your room?) I know I'm a little bit biased, but my wedding was BEAUTIFUL. Everything turned out better than I ever could have hoped for. My vision for my wedding day was executed exactly; how many brides can say that? Annie Mammoser is the wedding coordinator at the hotel, and whatever they're paying her, I'm sure it's not enough, because she is amazing. Anything I wanted or needed, she was on it. She made sure all the little details were seen to........ I did not spend a single second worrying about anything on my wedding day. Even everything leading up to that (the tasting, meeting with linen rental vendor, multiple walk-throughs with my florist) was stress-free. The space is really beautiful (love the chandelier and the bar area), and it's nice to have it all to yourself (rather than being one of several weddings at a larger hotel or banquet hall). We took some beautiful pictures in front of the Marion Street entrance, and all the extra seating area made for a really fabulous cocktail hour. (The only thing I'm kind of bummed out about now is that I didn't get to have any of the awesome hors d'oeuvres we selected since I was so busy taking pictures and saying hi to everyone.) As far as cost goes - totally a bargain! 102 people for dinner, copious amounts of alcohol and hours of dancing cost us less than $10,000. Try doing that in downtown Chicago. (Not to mention the two complimentary nights in a suite that we were given. The room was amazing, and it was really nice to be comped like that.) I've now been married for a month, and my friends and family are still talking about the food (really, really delicious!), the candy buffet (set up by Annie, perfectly!), and how much fun they had (possibly due to 5 hours of open bar). A perfect setting for one of the best days of my life (so far).",0,
"Beautiful ballroom and bar area. Great ambiance. We had about 65 people at our wedding reception and suprisingly the ballroom wasn't too big, however, since the bar area is down a little corridor, people pretty much ventured to the bar to drink and lounge after dinner/dancing. It was intimate, people we're able to meet and talk. Since we had a small party, everyone could fit comfortably into the large bar area. The food was from Philanders and it was awesome across the board- the fav main dish was the beef and tilapia. YUMMY! We received a complimentary room which worked out well, we used it as our home base. It was close to the reception area and was very well kept with a old fashioned flair. I'm very happy with how the reception turned out, I think the hotel is great for smaller weddings and is a wonderful place if you want to get away from the typical Holiday Inn reception. Our course it comes with a price tag, but it was worth it! One more side note for wheelchair users: I was concerned since a couple of the guests are wheelchair-bound and the hotel reception area is actually on a couple levels. The hotel isn't accessible with ramps throughout, but they have lifts throughout to accomodate even larger electric wheelchairs. I was surprised the lifts were insulated very well because you couldn't hear the noise in the ballroom.",0,
"I actually live real close to the Carleton but recently had a one night's stay the day before my wedding. I was lucky to stay in the hotel (instead of the motel section) which had a HUGE whirlpool tube. I would recommend staying at this hotel just to enjoy it. The staff was extremely helpful when my makeup artist needed a special chair to do makeup and they also were nice enough to let me stay a little after check out time. When I was in a rush at the last minute to leave, they checked me out without me having to wait. Thank you so much! The only down side: I left my bridal gown bag at the hotel (in fact I saw it but was in a rush to leave but didn't have time to go back). I called later that night but the maid service claimed nothing was found. The bag was pretty expensive, but I know it's my fault. My only recommendation is don't leave anything behind by accident.",0,
"I worked at a wedding at the Carleton last week. It is a gorgeous petite boutique hotel in downtown Oak Park. The ballroom is perfect for a wedding between 100-150 guests.  For the cocktail hour, the hotel used a small banquet room as well as a bar with two small rooms right off of it. The only thing that I disliked is that some guests were walking through the cocktail hour to get to their rooms on that side of the hotel.",0,
"I'm surprised to see a review of the motor lodge that says the rooms have an ""old but clean look"". I'm not sure if the rooms have been redone recently or not, or if the motor lodge that others have reviewed is a totally different section. From my understanding, however, my friend did stay in the motor inn section. The room was pretty modern, with a flat screen TV, kitchenette, and a pretty nice bathroom when compared with your average motel-type rooms. We were both believing he would be staying in the main hotel, yet were both somewhat impressed by the room, which he described as ""artsy"". For the price, the room was great. I'm not sure if his price was lower because he placed his reservation online or not, but it was a pretty sweet deal. The room had two beds, a table with four chairs, a flat panel TV, a kitchenette with coffee maker and comp coffee, dishes, silverware, microwave, mini frig, and cabinets. The room had a little hallway which led to both the closet and bathroom. There's no dresser in the room, but a wall with drawers in the back of this little hall. The closet has more than ample space, plus two extra pillows, two extra blankets, iron, full sized ironing board, an extra roll of toilet tissue, and plenty of towels is the bathroom. The only ""bad"" thing was that I saw no ice machine anywhere. There was however a soda machine outside. The beds were fairly comfortable as far as motel beds go, and he had no problems with anything in the room, aside from the wifi being slow. Everything worked, the front desk staff was incredibly helpful, and everything was just great. I've stayed in a few motels, as well has motels pretending to be hotels, and this is by far my favorite. The next time I want to just get away for the weekend, it's nice to know that I don't have to leave the state or even Oak Park, to find a nice, relaxing hotel at a fair price for a night or two.",1,""" this is by far my favorite"""
"We booked a block of rooms for our wedding this July at the Carleton. The hotel was very pretty and our room was spacious and had lots of character. Dana, who I worked with to book the rooms, was very helpful and returned my calls promptly. The best part was that by 10 of our guests booking their rooms at the Carleton, we got our room free!  The only reason I didn't rate this a five is because I felt that the rooms are overpriced for the service, location and what the hotel can offer.",0,
I had my wedding ceremony and reception at this hotel. The day was perfect. The banquet manager Annie is amazing! I felt very comfortable with her from the start. She is very organized and professional. She is extremely nice and very caring. She made sure my day was perfect. I'm so glad I had my wedding at this hotel!,0,
"We had a teeny little dinner (18 people) here the night before the boy's Bar Mitzvah, and some of our guests stayed here. A lovely hotel with gracious service. You won't get a pool and fitness center, but the location and charm more than make up for it. Dana and Annelise gave our small-scale event the same attention and service that they'd give to a 200-person wedding. The food was was tasty, though not very inventive. The thing is, that you won't get away cheap. There are room charges on top of the food charges, which is why we had the main event at Maggiano's.",0,
"The location met our needs, and the hotel staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. However, there were certain negative aspects that could not be fixed by a simple call to the front desk. At this price point, you do not get what you pay for. If we're simply talking about the quality of the rooms, I would say $75/night, $80 tops. Certainly not $188.  Overall, the biggest concerns were the rooms' smell, and the rooms' cleanliness. Even though it is a non-smoking hotel, the first room I was given was stuffy and smelled of smoke. It reminded me of an old room in a B&B that is rarely used. I get the impression that lots of weddings happen at this hotel, so I think people party in the rooms, and staff does not necessarily enforce the non-smoking policy. One of the restaurants in the lobby is fairly new, and management did not adequately consider how the hotel's layout and air flow (or lack thereof) might let the smell of the restaurant linger in the elevators and the hallways of the upper floors. There is radiator heat in the rooms, which is fine. There are also wall air conditioner units, but there are no instructions- just a remote- and it took some time to dicifer.  The rooms just look dingey. The comforters are pilling due to wear, blankets old. The pillows had yellow stains. Furnishings look somewhat grungey on the surface, as though they haven't been wiped down properly. The wallpaper and sofa had white stains. The bathroom had mildew.  When the first room I had smelled of smoke (I have a severe smoke allergy), to the hotel's credit, I was (very nicely) given a second room without question. While the smell of smoke in the second room was less, the room was no cleaner. Both rooms hadn't been vacuumed well, and there was grit and dirt in the carpet.  In addition, a previous guest had spilled coffee grounds in one area, and no one had cleaned it up. I understand that due to the age of the building, that most funds must be put into the exterior, and keeping it up to code. That being, said, for the money you are paying, I think the owners should seriously consider addressing some of these problems.",1,"""It reminded me of """
"We stayed in the motor lodge for work and those rooms are just so so, kind of an old look but clean. The resturant Barklays is pretty nice, the food is good, but the female server wasn't all that friendly.",0,
"I had my wedding here, have had my family stay here on several occasions. Best value. Best Location. Trains to the city are a block a way. (but why would you leave Oak Park?) everything in walking distance... even the motel rooms are MOD, and fab, (recently updated) Restaurants are wonderful too. You will enjoy the locals at Poor Phils, Ask for the beer of the day. I would totally recommend this hotel for weddings. Easy access, walk around abilty, and top notch everything. John Mahoney from Frasier even came to my reception- well, he was in the bar for the after party!",1,"""Best value. Best Location"""
"We had both our wedding ceremony and reception at the Carleton in May 2011. It was the first vendor we booked, and we have absolutely no regrets. Annie, the banquet manager, is organized, professional, and always quick to respond to any emails or questions. I found their policies regarding weddings much more flexible than other places. The hotel itself is beautiful and provides an entire section for your wedding, including a gorgeous bar area with sitting rooms for cocktail hour.  The ballroom is a smaller and more intimate than many hotel ballrooms which I preferred for our 100 person wedding. In addition, the prices and catering minimums are much more reasonable than any place I looked at in Chicago.  The food is catered by Barclays located in the hotel and was delicious, and we received many compliments on it and the hotel as a whole.",0,
I love this hotel. My fiance and I had our engagement party here and everyone loved the food and the atmosphere. The food is excellent and the service is great. The outdoor seating at Poor Phil's is lovely in the summer. We often ride our bikes here and sit outside for lunch when the weather is nice. We have stayed in their suites a couple of times and love their oversized jacuzzi tub.,0,
"Classic location for smaller wedding/event with multiple rooms for different activities if you like to sit and talk away from main action. The neighborhood is quiet and a nice choice if you want to be a little out of the city, but still close enough.  The staff is always courteous and helpful. A classic gem in Oak Park.",0,
"I had my wedding (ceremony and reception) at The Carleton in Sept, 2009. The whole day was perfect - mainly thanks to Anne Mammoser Parker's hard work! Our wedding was the second of the day, and Anne got her team to turn the place around (and make it sparkle) in no time flat. The ceremony set-up was perfect, and the turn-around for a 165-person dinner happened like clockwork. Working with Anne during the preparations was a piece of cake, too. She was always available for a meeting or a phone call, and responded to emails immediately. Taking us through the tastings, to making suggestions about layout, Anne definitely listened to what we wanted and produced just that for the wedding. The hotel ballroom-area is beautiful. I received compliments all night about how amazing the hotel is, and what a fantastic venue it is for a wedding. The decor is perfect, and the size is just right. It's as formal or informal as you want it to be. The bar and two adjoining rooms are romantic and cozy, and perfect for quiet conversations and cushy seating. The hotel rooms are fabulous, too. We stayed in a room that was absolutely perfect. It was right up the stairs from the bar, and it had everything we wanted. The bathrooms are very ornate and updated, and the decor in the rooms is really unique. Truly a fantastic place for a wedding and other events! Anne is perfect to work with!",0,
"My wedding has happened. It happened at the Carleton and it was fantastic. The most fantastic wedding I have ever been to; I am so proud to say it was mine. Annie Parker, special events coordinator extraordinaire, oversaw this event with care and love and attention to every detail - as if it were her own. Annie and I have gotten to know each other pretty well over the past year or so. I have emailed her daily for weeks at a time with silly questions and requests and advice and she has always responded with clear, thorough responses and always with our best interest in mind. The staff at The Carleton deserve some recognition. I had quite the crowd -- the most bottles ever consumed at one event. Yup, that's us! We had a few scenarios that would've thrown the average banquet staff off their game, but not this one! I can't say enough about the conscientious effort to make my wedding the best it can possibly be. The food was amazing -- we had chosen honey mustard crusted chicken, rib eye and salmon. All deserving high marks. All the guests that made mention of the food were pleasantly surprised with the quality AND quantity of these dishes. The rib eye was the most consumed entree and this piece of meat was something to be expected at a high end steak house. Very nice. Our room was beautiful, clean and large. We had 12 other guests booked at the hotel and all were pleased as well. Poor Phil's is the bar and grill which I have reviewed in the past, but will mention that they serve a great breakfast! Several guests enjoyed the morning after here.",0,
"I cannot say enough good things about Anne Parker and the Carleton Hotel. We had our wedding there last weekend, and all the guests stayed there as well. Anne did an amazing job with planning our ceremony and cocktail hour! She was so professional and knowledgeable. From the first day we met, I knew I was working with the right person. Anne is amazingly good at what she does, and takes all of the tasks related to wedding planning very seriously. So much so, it helped me to be at ease knowing she had the details under control. I could not have been happier with Anne and the venue as a whole. Their beautiful vintage bar was perfect for our cocktail reception and photos. Additionally, I heard nothing but good things from guests about the hotel itself. I stayed there the night before the wedding and can attest to how nice the rooms are. The Carleton was the perfect venue for our wedding! Thank you Anne,and the Carleton Hotel, for exceeding every expectation!",0,
